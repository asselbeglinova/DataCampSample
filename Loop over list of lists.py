Remember the house variable from the Intro to Python course? Have a look at its definition on the right. It's basically a list of lists, where each sublist contains the name and area of a room in your house.

It's up to you to build a for loop from scratch this time!
# house list of lists
house = [["hallway", 11.25], 
         ["kitchen", 18.0], 
         ["living room", 20.0], 
         ["bedroom", 10.75], 
         ["bathroom", 9.50]]

for x in house :
       print("the" + x[0] + " is " + str(x[1]) + "sqm")'''
