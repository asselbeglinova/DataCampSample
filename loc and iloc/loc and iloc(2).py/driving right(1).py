'''Remember that cars dataset, containing the cars per 1000 people (cars_per_cap) and whether people drive right (drives_right) for different countries (country)? The code that imports this data in CSV format into Python as a DataFrame is available on the right.

In the video, you saw a step-by-step approach to filter observations from a DataFrame based on boolean arrays. Let's start simple and try to find all observations in cars where drives_right is True.

drives_right is a boolean column, so you'll have to extract it as a Series and then use this boolean Series to select observations from cars.
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Extract drives_right column as Series: dr
dr = cars["drives_right"]

# Use dr to subset cars: sel
sel = cars [dr]

# Print sel
print(sel)'''
